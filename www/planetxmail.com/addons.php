  <b>Credit Mailer</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  SafeLists in their golden years 2000-2003 were new and exciting and effective.  Over the years this effectiveness had
  been tarnished with the advent of Auto-Submitters.  People were not reading the ADs.
  With the Credit Mailer not only are your ADs read, but your Website is directly visited as well, in order for the
  reader to earn the credits.  The credits can then be used to purchase a variety of things like; More mailing, AD Space,
  Banner Impressions and Link Exchanges. <a href="http://planetxmail.com/creditmailerhowto.php" target="_blank">Click for More info</a>

  <p>
  <b>URL Tracking</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  URL Trackers record when a URL/Link is clicked. You specify your destination URL/Link and a unique URL (Tracker) is created
  for use in your AD campaigns.

  <b>Blog Blaster</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  All Planet X Mail SafeList members that signup will have access to our Blogger Blaster.  It is a Bulleton Board which allows
  you to post your AD where others are posting.  There is a strict one posting per AD per day to minimize over posting. This
  service is 100% Free to all Planet X Mail members!

  <b>AD Space Builder</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  You can create <i>Bill Board</i> style ADs along with your uploaded image logos of your company.
  Everytime a member of your SafeList mails out these ADs will be displayed.
  You can then <i>sell</i> AD space if you have a large enough list. This is a great way to notify others
  of products and services others are offering.<br>
