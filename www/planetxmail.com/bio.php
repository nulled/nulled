	<h3>Matt. ( A short BIO ) Planet X Mail Founder</h3>
	First of all, why did Matt write a biography about him in the first place?  Well, the internet can sometimes be deceiving.  All you
	see are pictures and text which represent a business online.  Sometimes, you just don't know what your buying into or what
	really could be happening.  There are many legit websites that are true to their words and there are just as many that are
	NOT.  He is writting this to try and get rid of some of the shroud or mystery.
	<br><br>
	Matt was born 1974 in Sanoma, Cali.  He grew up in Boise, ID until he moved to Anchorage, Alaska when he was in 4th grade
	and lived in Alaska until he turned 21.  At age 21 he moved to Seattle, WA where he currently lives.
	<br><br>
	Matt started out his career thinking he would be an Electronics Tech, repairing anything from TV's to computers.  He had a few jobs
	in this field and found it to be plain depressing.  He felt more like a machine at a bench, a slave to the machine, more than
	a person.  It was basically assembly line work.  Well, he dropped out of that business and pursued other avenues like computers.
	Which for a long time he used for internet and games, but never really thought about them as a career.  Perhaps because he was too
	wrapped up in himself ( self exploration ) and pursuing music and exploring his city, Seattle.  Basically, getting into computers
	to him seemed "nerdy" and time consuming.  So, he mostly "scrapped by" with temp jobs and being in the Reserve helped pay for some
	things as well.
	<br><br>
	Matt then started to study computers more heavily after finding that computers DID interest him. He got his MCSE, which is a series
	of courses you take to get certified in Networking Computers.  Back in 1998 or so MCSE was a BIG DEAL.  Now it's just a passing
	fad.  Anyhow, after getting his MCSE he was able to land a job with the tyrants at M$ ( Microsoft ) as a beta tester.  They tested
	Windows 2000 Remote Installation Service and he was there for the Windows 2000 "party", which by the way is free beer and food til you puke
	AND you are getting paid by the hour to do so! Well, that happened every Friday there so, it was nothing special. :)
	<br><br>
	Well, it was at Microsoft that Matt got into Programming.  He saw the Programmers ( Coders ) there being all bad ass running around
	fixing code and being the silent "known it all types".  They had their OWN office and knew more than their boss!  They were the
	ones that seemed to be incharge!  The Bosses would just coach em on or just stay outta their way altogether!  So, Matt looked at what
	he was doing.  He was installing the SAME software over and over everyday and had his boss hovering around him all the time while he
	got to sit there and wait for a bug to report or what have you.  Well, he decided to dedicate himself to coding.  He went
	strait for the throat.  He ONLY took college courses that involved the learning of the C, C++ and JAVA.  Which, by the way, is
	the best way to go since each language has only 3 courses to complete then your a Certified Coder in that language!!! How easy
	is that!  Well in 2 years you can become Master Coder, if you take this approach.
	<br><br>
	So, everyday Matt would go into M$ and boot his software like usual except this time while the other guys where surfin the net
	or playing around with their BUG hunts, he would be secretly studing and reading about code.  Well, since he also did volunteer work
	to program some simple scripts for his boss.  He didn't know the FIRST THING about the scripting part but, volunteered anyways and had
	confidence he would just figure it out as he went. :)  Well, he managed to act like he could code but since he didn't have any hardcore
	experience at it, his boss noticed it took him just alittle too long to get the scripts done.  Even though he would finish it eventually.
	Well, the point was, he knew he COULD code given the time allowed to study.  But, since he had
	to come into work everyday, and it's not the best place to learn to code particularly when you have "work" to do. So, Matt decided to
	NOT try to go Full Time there at Microsoft.  Even though he probably could have, as a Beta Tester.  He decided
	to drop out after the 1 year temp position expired and left 1 day EARLY actually.
	<br><br>
	So, Matt filed for Unemployment benefits!
	<br><br>
	Ahhh... now Matt had $300 a week checks coming in from all the slavery at M$ AND he could be at home to study!  Well, he was determined!
	He can tell you that all he did for 3 months was READ, CODE, EAT, READ, CODE and did he mentioned READ and CODE?  Doing his online
	and in person college classes in C, C++, and JAVA.  Well, his first project was a GAME, which is a pretty large under taking for
	a FIRST C++ project!  Matt was lucky to know a really good game programmer online and Matt would be his friend while he would
	answer his burage of questions.  Matt also learns fast so that helped.
	<br><br>
	In anycase all was well until the Unemployment checks RAN OUT, as they unfortunetly do.  Matt was at $1000 in his bank account and
	rent due in a few weeks.  It was time to go on another Resume submit trip.  But, this time he, at least, was certified in C and C++.
	He was still trying to complete JAVA classes but, never did to this day. And to the industry JAVA is the money maker.  So, he decided
	to try something new and apply for Tele-Commute jobs, which a friend was doing so he thought he would give it a try.  He sent his
	resume out to monster.com and all those online resume submittion places, hoping for the BEST but, expecting the WORSE.
	<br><br>
	Well, Matt got two replys.  One was from a local there in Seattle that needed some basic PHP work done. ( PHP is a scripting language that
	websites use with databases and stuff. )  And, one from a 54 year old man in Australia named Phil offering nothing more than the 100%
	guarantee that if Matt coded some of Phil's ideas THEY would make a lot of money, which they would split 50/50.
	<br><br>
	Well, the PHP work offer seemed legit since he had the site and work needed to be done.  He paid Matt $200 for some work and he decided to
	NOT give Matt anymore because Matt refused to go through all the Tax stuff and file for Matt's OWN taxes instead of him just having Matt
	sign a W2 form.  He was basically a LAZY employeer and Matt was not about to waste all his time filing for his OWN taxes working for
	the employeer!  Seems backwards doesn't it, on the employeer's part?
	<br><br>
	So, then Matt's ONLY other response was from Phil, the 54 yr old in Australia.  It was a gamble to say the least.  All Phil's "ideas"
	seemed so far away and a dream.  Matt needed money NOW!  Well, to Matt it was not all about the money.  Matt just wanted to CODE.
	He wanted to code projects and collaberate with people.  So, besides the other 4 people he was coding for FREE ( Cause mind you
	Matt wanted the experience more than the money, since a NEW coder has to start somewhere. ) Matt decided to give Phil's ideas a try.
	<br><br>
	Well, to make a long story short, Matt coded 5 MAJOR projects from June, 2001 to Feb 2002.  Multi-URL Tracker, Biz Board Pro,
	Multi-List PRO, Multi-List Enterprise ( Enterprise is what Planet X Mail uses as it's SafeList script engine ) and finally Ezy List Pro.
	<br><br>
	Multi-URL Tracker is what kept Matt and Phil's company financed until the BIG scripts like Biz Board Pro and Multi-List scripts were complete.
	Well, like everyone in a new business, they made their calculations for "WHAT IF" senerios and thought they would become VERY rich.  Well, turned out
	that didn't happen!  They did make enough to work from HOME, that was GOOD ENOUGH and they were happy!
	<br><br>
	Well, during this time of coding Matt was also listening to Phil and his business mind.  He learned A LOT from Phil in how you can
	market and sell to people and what a successful business model would be.  Matt then applied his OWN theories and thoughts to Phil's
	and "expanded" apon them.  Before Matt was just the "coder" now he was evolving himself to, not only CODE, but also "think" like a business
	type and APPLY those coding skills to meaningful projects that would make him money!  So, now Phil and Matt are still Partners with EzyListPro
	and they share resources between their two List Hosting Companies.  Matt does not code for anyone now except himself.  Since, Matt guesses, after almost
	1 FULL YEAR of coding his A** off, he would ease up and just code new projects at his leisure.
	<br><br>
	Planet X Mail, of course, is Matt's business.  He built it from scratch.  Everything from the web pages to the scripts.  On his own.  He even does
	the graphics for the company and answers all email support questions.  Matt feels very lucky, VERY LUCKY, to have found a Linux Admin that is
	smarter than ANYONE Matt has met, when it comes to Linux Server setup and he does code work as well.  "W" is the only name this Linux GURU wishes
	to be known as, "W" is a Prodigy for Linux/Unix.  Matt has
	interviewed DOZENS of other Server Admins and "W" always knew everything they knew and MORE.  "W" needs to be given credit for
	how well Planet X Mail runs as a Server/Business.  "W" is behind the scenes getting dirty while you guys can enjoy the mailing speed and smooth
	server operations.  Matt owes this guy his life! "W" has coded all the bounce back handling programs, which is written in THREE different languages.
	"W" is the qmail server setup wiz kid and security manager.  Basically, "W" handles the obsure hard to understand Linux/Debain operations.  Running
	a SafeList host is NOT possible unless you have mail servers that can handle the demands.  "W" has defined a NEW term to the meaning, "Yes, it is
	possible to tweek a server to use EVERY LAST ounce of its capability.  Would you like another?".  Gotta love this guy. :)
	<br><br>
	So, in a nut shell.  Matt described to you how this company came to be and a little about him.  Matt hopes that you enjoyed reading this
	and perhaps even inspires those with similar ambitions and dreams that you CAN obtain what you conceive, if you stick to it and
	work HARD.  For 1 year Matt worked about 18 hours a day everyday.  But, it was well worth it and fun, he reports!

	<br><br>
	P.S. - Planet X Mail is 100% Double Optin Based.  It's servers and scripts are coded to be as such.  SafeLists tend to carry
	the "vibe" that mailing lists are SPAM.  There ARE those that do spam and do not really have LEGAL DOUBLE OPTIN systems in place like
	Planet X Mail does.
	Unfortunetly, we sometimes get tagged with this, even though we are willing to OPEN ourselfs up to ANYONE that wishes to see our
	Double OPTIN script code and we will answer to ANYONE that claims us to be spamming them.  We are dedicated to serving LEGAL and LEGITIMATE
	SafeList / NewsLetter communites that wish to do business using Double Optin SafeLists / NewsLetters.
	<br><br>
	If you have further questions about our systems or anything else related Matt would like to hear from you. Open Door Policy as it were.
