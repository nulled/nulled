        <b>Attention is brought to <i>your</i> Email ADs <u>and</u> Websites.</b> How?
        <ol>
          <li>Prospects looking for the 'Credit URLs' must at least scan your Email ADs.</li>
          <li>Prospects <u>must</u> view your website, in a browser, <i>before</i> Credits are Deposited.</li>
        </ol>

        <b>A win-win situation for <u>both</u> the Sender <u>and</u> Receiver.</b> Why?
        <ol>
          <li><i>Sender Benefits</i> by distributing Desirable Credit URLs which direct prospects to their Emails and Websites.</li>
          <li><i>Receiver Benefits</i> by Earning Credits which can be used to buy more Advertising.</li>
          <ul>
            <li><font color="red"><b>New!</b></font> Planet X Mail Credits are now Transferable to Targeted AD Planet! <a href="http://targetedadplanet.com" target="_blank">Learn more about Free AD Planet.</a></li>
          </ul>
        </ol>

        <font color="red"><b>When you use our Solo AD mailing system readers earn 5 times the normal amount of credits.</b> <a href="soloads.php?list=credmailhowto"><b>Send a Solo Ad Now!</b></a></font>

        <br /><br />

        <b>Each credit earned equates to one mailable SafeList member.</b> <i>Or, Credits can be Transfered to Targeted AD Planet</i> <a href="http://targetedadplanet.com" target="_blank">Learn more about Free AD Planet.</a>

        <br /><br />

        Earn credits by looking for the URL <b>http://planetxmail.com/earn.php</b> in email ADs you receive from
        the SafeList. How many credits earned is set by the List Owner.

        <br /><br />

        At the bottom of both Mailers you will see a text box labeled <b>Credit URL</b>.

        Entering your website URL in the <b>Credit URL</b> text box will place Earnable Credit URLs/Links, inside your
        email AD.

        <ul>
          <li>Free Members - Neither Mailers allow your <b>Credit URL</b> to be entered.</li>
          <li>Professionals - Only the Regular Mailer allows your <b>Credit URL</b> to be entered.</li>
          <li>Executives - <u><b>Both Mailers</b></u> allow your <b>Credit URL</b> to be entered.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>It is highly beneficial for you in using the Credit URL</b>.
        Upgrading to Professional or Executive status is highly recommended but not required if you wish to use the Regular/Credit Mailers.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Closing thoughts.</b>  In order for a Business Community, using SafeLists, to function with any degree of effectiveness,
        all must read at least some of the incoming ADs and visit other peoples websites!  Participation is key.  If everyone simply
        uses Automation Tools then walks away thinking the system is to be effective at exposing your ADs to others, then everyone must
        participate in properly using the SafeList System.  The Credit System, now built into all Planet X Mail SafeLists, addresses and encourages
        the SafeList Community to do just that... participate! It is a win-win for all and hopefully can be fun at the same time!
