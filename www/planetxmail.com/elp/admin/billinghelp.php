			These are Billed to you by Elite Scripts on the <b>1st</b> and <b>15th</b> of every month.
			All members that have paided you will be recorded as a transaction and then
			when a Billing Period occurs that transaction appears on your Billing Period
			reports, listed below. You can click the Dates for each to expand and allow a
			detailed viewing of each transaction billed.<br>

			reports</i> until the <b>1st</b> and <b>15th</b>.
