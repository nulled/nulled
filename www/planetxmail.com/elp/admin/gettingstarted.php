			<h3>Welcome Aboard! - Getting Started</h3>
			You are now an ELP Partner.  This <b>instantly</b> means you have access to incredible potential for <b>wealth</b>.
			<br>
			<br>
			I will explain what you need to do to <b>get started</b>.  And how to maintain your account.  It is easy
			and most of the system runs itself.

				<li>Please note that you need to have <b>AT LEAST one</b> merchant account "checked" so you can get paid!</li>
				<li>There is <b>no need to provide merchant paylinks on your sales pages</b>.  Because, the system auto-completes all the work for you in setting up accounts and tracks all transactions.</li>
			</ul>
			To <i>TEST</i> the merhant accounts you set up, you can create a ELP Member username by the name of <b>test_me</b>  This
			account will only be charged .05 cents for sign up and monthly fees.  Use this account as <b>your own</b>
			<i>personal</i> ELP Member account as well. If you would like to use Ezy-List Pro for yourself.  This <b>test_me</b>
			account will <b>not appear</b> as billable on your Periodic billings from us. Also, <b>DO NOT share this account</b>.  We track <b>ALL</b> IP
			address and if the system determines that more than one member is using the same account.. it will be blocked and put
			under further investigation.
