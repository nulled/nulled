			<h3>Rates Explained</h3>
			When a member Signs up you are charging them a ONE time fee PLUS first months fee.
			<br><br>
			We ask $20 per Sign-up fee plus $5 per Monthly fee which means we receive $25 per Sign-up you sell.
			<br><br>
			You <b>could</b> set your Sign-up fee to $10 and set your Monthly fee to $35 which totals $45 per Sign-up.
			<br>
			Regardless of what you set, we <b>still</b> ask $20 per Sign-up fee plus $5 per monthly which totals $25.
			<br>
			<br>
			As you can see this arrangement <b>works</b>. $45 you - $25 us = $20 you... and you come out on top per Sign-up.
			<hr>
			Now, lets look at an arrangement that does <b>NOT</b> work for Sign-ups.
			<br><br>
			You set your Sign-up fee to $10 and your Monthly fee to $10 which totals $20.
			<br>
			We <b>still</b> ask $20 per Sign-up fee plus $5 per Monthly which totals $25.
			<br>
			<br>
			$20 you - $25 us = <i>negative</i> 5 you!  This arragement does <b>not</b> work when a member Signs up.
			You need to set either your Monthly higher or Sign-up fee higher to compensate.
			<hr>
			Here is an example of a Monthly re-newal fee that does <b>not</b> work.
			<br><br>
			Lets say you set your Sign-up see to $25 and your Monthly fee to $3 which totals $28.
			<br>
			<br>
			$3 you - $5 us = <i>negative</i> $2 you... for each of your monthly re-newals.  Does <b>not</b> works.
			<br>
			<br>
			Setting your Monthly to $6 will make it work at a <b>minimum</b>. Because, that is $ 1 <i>above</i> what we are
			asking per Monthly re-newal you get.
