  No, it is EASY to run a Safe-List with us.  You need no technical experience.  If you know how to click a
  mouse you are a go.  We are always here to help and answer questions.  The script is so powerful it
  handles all the details for you.

  Yes!  Thats the point of owning a SafeList, to provide an advertising mechanism for your
  members to advertise with.  It is just a matter of setting up your list using our control panels.
  Everything else is handled  by our systems.

  Yes, you can upload your OWN title graphics and name the list what ever you want.  You can add your own HTML to create
  your own Home Page members first see when they log in. In the future we plan to add even more customization like font style, color and more.
