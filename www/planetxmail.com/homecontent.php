  <b>Our</b> Safelists are safe. Safe meaning...
  <ul>
    <li><b>No Planet X Mail SafeList will ever initiate an invitation to join a SafeList.</b></li>
    <li>Confirm / authentication hashed links must be clicked on to join. <b>Double OPTIN</b>.</li>
    <li>Confirm links are sent to the owner of the email box, <b>only the owner can validate it</b>.</li>
    <li>Once joined, all email addresses remain hidden and protected from all other members.</li>
    <li>While joined, a strict weekly limit of Safelist resources is enforced, per member.
    <li>100% departure from our Safelists will be as hassle free as clicking <b>one hyperlink</b>.</li>
    <li>Once departed, you will cease to receive email from that departed Safelist.</li>
    <li>Finally, account information is <b>never</b> transferred or held in <b>any</b> database, once departed.</li>
<!--    <li><font color="red"><i><b>See our Friendly Warning below about so called,"Viral Mailers".</b></i></font></li> -->
  </ul>

  Our Safelists are a <b>Friendly Community</b> that communicates, <b>only to it's Members</b>, about the Market Place. Once you
  Opt out, there is no "Three Day Processing Period".  When you click Unsubscribe you are removed, <i>immediately</i>, <b>Period.</b>
  <br /><br />
  Safelists go beyond current CAN-SPAM laws because CAN-SPAM currently fails to patch many security loop holes.
  <a href="#canspam">CLICK HERE</a> to read why.
  <br /><br />
  <b><u>DOUBLE</u> OPT-IN</b> <u>should not be confused</u> with regular OPT-IN.
  <br /><br />
  Regular OPT-IN <i>does not</i> validate the authenticity of a list join.
  <br /><br />
<!--  <font color="red"><b>Friendly Warning:</b></font> There are now websites that claim to be <b>"Viral Mailers"</b>
            that once you get on their list, will Spam you to no end. ANY Website that ONLY accepts a Gmail account should
            put you on <font color="red">High Alert</font> that they will Spam you, even if you Unsubscribe.

  <b>Our SafeList design model goes beyond current CAN-SPAM laws in the following ways.</b>
  <ol>
    <li>We will <u>never</u> <i>initiate</i> an email invitation of any kind to anyone about anything.</li>
    <li>We do not manage an <font color="red"><u>un</u></font>subscribe list, but rather a subscribe list.</li>
    <li>Once unsubscribed, all account information is permanently deleted and never held nor transferred.</li>
  </ol>
  In 2003, the U.S. Federal Government passed the <b>C</b>ontrolling the
  <b>A</b>ssault of <b>N</b>on-<b>S</b>olicited <b>P</b>ornography <b>A</b>nd <b>M</b>arketing Act,
  which is widely referred to as the CAN-SPAM Act.
  This means, <i>by default</i>, the CAN-SPAM Act <i>allows</i> initial transmission of an email ad and it is up
  to the receiver of the ad to click and join an <font color="red"><u>un</u></font>subscribe list!
  <b>Look at our rule #1 and #2 (above) once more...</b>

  <br /><br />
  <b>Safelists do not follow this <font color="red"><u>un</u></font>subscribe model but rather the opposite.</b>
  <br /><br />

  <font color="green"><b>We rely on the <i>Nature of the Internet</i> to self promote Planet X Mail. Search Engines and word-of-mouth are
  the mechanisms used in building our community base. We believe the Internet is about choice, not propaganda.</b></font>
  <br /><br />

  A way to confirm how compliant a domain is, when it comes to it's emailing habits, is to look up that domain on
  <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/query/bl?ip=205.252.250.4" target="_blank">SBL lists - click here</a>. These SBL lists
  (spam blocking lists) are maintained in the U.K. and not in the U.S.

  <br /><br />
  As a measure, of Planet X Mail's Safelist innovations, note that all CAN-SPAM regulations were enforced <b>three years before</b> the U.S. Government
  made them official laws. What is more interesting is that Planet X Mail continues ahead of the CAN-SPAM Act, by enforcing our secure Double OPT-IN
  signup process.
  <br /><br />

  <b>Not all Safelists are created and maintained equally...</b> Safelists are everywhere. Do not join a Safelist unless you are sure
  the operators know what they are doing.
  <br /><br />
  On top of all the Regulatory features, below are some highlights of our Safelists.
  <ul>
    <li>Regular and Credit Based.</li>
    <li>Builtin Payment Processing of various types.</li>
    <li>Easy management of three member status levels.</li>
    <li>Protected by Turing Keys to stop abuse.</li>
    <li>Member benefits like a Blogger, URL Tracking and ways to spend Credits.</li>
    <li>Hosted on our servers so we handle all the details, including our Email Bounce Algorithms.</li>
  </ul>
