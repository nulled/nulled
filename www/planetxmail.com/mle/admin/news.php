      <font color="red"><b>May 16, 2007</b> - NEW Changes to Credit System!</font>
      <ul>
        <li>We changed the amount of credits users can earn.</li>
        <li>There is a 1000 credit cap on Sign ups and a 50 credit cap per URL Clicked.</li>
        <li>We did this because people where asking why they reached their cap... The database can only hold a number so large.</li>
        <li>Listowners should set the Earnable amount relative to list size, since the one credit equals one mailable member.</li>
        <li>If a member can earn 10,000 credits from one URL click then what is the point of a credit system?</li>
      </ul>
