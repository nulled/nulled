			<h3>How to use the Member Affiliate Referal System.</h3>
			<font size="1">Previously this was the Sign Up Form referal checker which was discontinued.</font>

			<h4>Why Have It?</h4>
      This could increase your membership sign up profits!

      <h4>What Is It?</h4>
      Everyone knows that a referal affliate system is a great way to allow others to promote your stuff while at the same time allowing
      them to make a percentage of the earnings!  This is a fully integrated system that you can use to allow ALL your current members
      the ablility to get Sign Ups for you!

      <h4>How Do I Use It?</h4>
      In the Edit Configurations Section of your Admin control panel.  Which, you should already be at, enter in the <i>Affiliate Director URL</i>.
      This URL should be <b>Your Web Site</b> or your <b>SafeList Sales pages</b>.  It is <i>NOT recommended</i> you set this to the Sign Up URL of your SafeList unless you do not care if people
      Sign Up with out seeing your Sales Pages.  The <i>Affiliate Director URL</i> will bring ALL your Members Affiliate URLs to this web page.<br>
      Note: Your SafeList members get their own URL to promote from in the Member Log in.
      <br><br>
      The system works off Cookies... so even if the prospect closes the browser it will still remember what Affiliate link ( Member ) referred them.
      SO they are free to navigate around YOUR sales pages (Web Site) all they want!
      <br><br>
      <i>If you do <b>NOT</b> wish to use this affiliate system.</i>  Simply leave the <i>Affiliate Director URL</i> <b>BLANK</b> and our SafeList script will autmomatically
      take out the Menus and Options pretaining to Referring, out of the system.  You may want to do this if you already have a good external
      affiliate script in place, or wish to not have it enabled.

      <h4>How does it work?</h4>
      When you have a URL entered in the <i>Affiliate Director URL</i> text field you are <b>enabling</b> this feature.  Your SafeList members then get their
      own personalized link, which is unique per Member, from the SafeList Member Log in area.  ( Note: An additional Menu is added called, <i>Affiliate Stats</i>
      from within the Members Log in. )
      <br><br>
      When someone clicks on a Members' Referral Link, that prospect is taken to a page where we determine if the Members' Referral Link is eligable for this Referral.
      <br><br>
      Member Referral Eligability Guide Lines are:
      <li>A) Member MUST have a List Email confirmed for that SafeList they are trying to Refer.</li>
      <li>B) Member must NOT have their vacation set ON at the time of the referal.</li>
      <br><br>
      Once, the Member has cleared eligability, a COOKIE is set and is valid for 1 FULL YEAR.  This means that even if
      the prospect decides to Sign Up at a later date, that referal information keeps. ( Unless the prospect happens to click on another
      members Referal link, <i>of the same list</i>, which will over ride the old one before the Sign Up occurs.  Note: Each SafeList our company hosts is
      entirely seperate from each other and will NOT conflict with other SafeLists. )
      <br><br>
      If the prospect Signs Up <i>AND</i> Verifies their account the system records what Member Referred them and that Member can check
      in their Profile how many referals and at what dates.

      <h4>How does a List Owner Manage all this?</h4>
      A section in Main Options->Affliate Manager, only if you set the <i>Affiliate Director URL</i> in your list configurations, will provide you all the
      tools nessasary for tracking which Members of your SafeList are getting Referals and if you have Paid them or not, through what ever methods you choose.
      <br><br>
      The only thing that you as List Owner must do when having the Member Affiliate system active is to pick times when you payout
      to your List Members the amount due... and simply checking the boxes for those you have paid.
      <br><br>
      <font color="red"><b>Important Note:</b></font> There are 3 status levels.  ONLY, Pro and Exe are calculatable by the Affiliate System.  Therefore if you SELL
      Memberships and assign them by default as Member Status ( free ) the system will treat it as such.  Meaning that members at status "Member" are always
      concidered to be a free sign up.  Its through the process of upgrading that a Free member can obtain Pro or Exe status.
      <br><br>
      It is possible to set the default status level on a sign up to any status level.  Simply, goto your <i>List Configurations</i> and set the
      <i>Default Status</i> drop down box.
      <br><br>
      You can also assign another parameter to your sign up links to include the status level upon sign up. Simply, add <b>&status=pro</b> or <b>&status=exe</b>
      to your sign up link.
