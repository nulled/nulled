      <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Step 1:</span> Please, add the Email: <b>do_not_reply@planetxmail.com</b> as a Contact
      in your Address Book. This is the best thing you can do, to let your Mail Service know you wish to receive Email from Planet X Mail,
      so you can mail your own Offerings. We use do_not_reply, because we have a <a href="/openticket.php" target="_blank">Ticket System</a>
      to handle Questions from our Customers.
      <br /><br />
      <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Step 2:</span> ANY emails that end up in your Spam/Junk folder that are from Planet X Mail,
      click <b>Is Not Spam</b> Button.  This is a way to communicate to your Mail Provider that you want mail
      from <i>do_not_reply@planetxmail.com</i> in your INBOX or Filtered by your Personal Mail Filters into Your Personally
      Created Folders.
      <br /><br />
      <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Step 3:</span> If you have tried adding <i>do_not_reply@planetxmail.com</i> to your Address
      Book and UnSpammed all messages in your Spam folder from Planet X Mail does not work, we have no choice but to change your Email Address.
      <br /><br />

      Email Address, possibly from a completely New Domain.
