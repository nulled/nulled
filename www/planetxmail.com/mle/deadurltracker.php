      <b>If you are reading this right now because you found the URL Tracker in a spam AD.</b>  Please read below:
      <br /><br />
      <u>The spam <b>DID NOT</b> originate from our servers.</u> The spammer mailed the spam from their own servers
      and used our URL Tracker in their spam. <a href="http://planetxmail.com/mle/spam_nfo/" target="_BLANK">Click Here</a>
      for information on how to read email headers.
      <br /><br />
      <a href="http://planetxmail.com" target="_BLANK">Planet X Mail</a> is a SafeList Hosting Company.
      We provide URL Trackers to our legitimate regular SafeList members that have Double-Optin inside a SafeList.
      Spammers sometimes use our URL Trackers in their spam to track how many times the link is clicked.
      <br /><br />
      If this is the case please <a href="http://planetxmail.com/openticket.php">Open a Ticket</a> immediately.
      Include the complete spam Email with the headers and that user account will be deleted immediately.
