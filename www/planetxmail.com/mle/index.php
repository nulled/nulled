      <p> <b>Multi-List Enterprise</b> is the # 1 SafeList / NewsLetter management and client tool currently available... <i>hands down</i> .</p>
      <p> <b>Multi-List Enterprise</b> stores all your data in <b>MySQL</b> © databases ensuring your data is corruption free, even in the event of read and write mishaps. <b>MySQL</b> is also about 10 times faster in reading and writting data.</p>
      <p>Other list managers use <i>flat-file</i> based storage that can easily become corrupt with no way to recover your lost data. And after 2,000 members join your list, <i>flat-file</i> techniques begin to fail altogether.</p>
      <p> <b>Multi-List Enterprise</b> is built on <b>PHP</b> technology, a new innovative scripting language that is taking the internet by storm. <b>PHP</b> is the most powerful, robust, and secure scripting language available. Similar products are programmed in <i>PERL</i>, which is complex, outdated, hard to install and prone to errors due to its complexity. <b>PHP</b> boasts fast, efficient and powerful features that <b>Multi-List Enterprise</b> exploits through and through.</p>
      <p><font color="red"> <b>If that wasn't enough the features in the box increase Multi-List Enterprise's value as well.</b> </font><br><br>Features like:<font style="font-family:verdana" size="-1">
