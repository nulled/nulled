Hello [list_name] Listowner,

The members listed below where removed from [list_name]
Safelist, after [months_inactive] MONTHS of No Activity.

--> They did not Login or Click any Credit URLs in Emails.

To turn off or Adjust your Auto-Clean feature, simply
log into Your Planet X Mail List Administrator Control
Panel and navigate to the List Wizard.

However, it is Highly Recommended that you have it set at
3 to 12 months of inactivity.  The system automatically
reminds each of Your Members after 30 Days to Login or
Click some Credit URLs to show they still care.

Log In to your List Owner Control Panel below:
