      The turing key is there to prevent other SafeList Submitters from accessing our SafeLists.  These SafeList Submitters could potentially
      be abused and over used and wish to allow only the SafeList Submitters we have control over to prevent abuse, if it should occur.  On the
      Sign Up form the Turing Key is to prevent automated Sign Up programs.

      <a name="turingkeyreload"><b>3. Why doesn't the Turing Key let me in?</b></a> - <a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a><br /><br />
      This may occur when your Web Browser "caches" the Log In page which now contains an OLD Turing key.  Simply hit F5 function key on your keyboard to
      refresh the Log In page and get a new Turing Key.
      <br />
      Also, the Turing Key has a limited life.  If you load the Log In page and walk away for more then a minute you will need to refresh the
      Log In page by hitting F5 function key on your key board to get a new Turing Key.

      <a name="urltracker"><b>4. How do I make and use a URL Tracker?</b></a> - <a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a><br /><br />
      <i>First</i>, you need to enter a "Friendly Name" for the URL tracker.<br />
      <i>Next</i>, enter the URL/Link you wish to Track and click, Submit URL Tracker.<br />
      <i>Finally</i>, select the URL that is given, this is your URL Tracker, and replace the Plain "Original" URL with the URL Tracker.
      <br /><br />
      Now, when someone clicks on the URL Tracker they are taken to our server, we record the hit then immediately send them on their way
      to the actual link, which is your website, or the URL you link it to.  The person clicking the link will never tell it goes to our server first
      so is a very effective way to count the number of times an AD is viewed.

      <a name="delete"><b>5. Why do I receive a Deletion Notice even after I logged into my account recently?</b></a> - <a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a><br /><br />
      If you continue to get deletion notices even after you log in, this means
      you have more than one account. Make sure that the deletion notice your getting matches the correct account you logged into! It may not
      be the same account you think!  The deletion Email has all the details like, List Name, User Name and Dates.

      <a name="missingmail"><b>6. Why don't I see my AD sent to my List Address for the SafeList I am mailing to?</b></a> - <a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a><br /><br />
      You should be getting your own AD to the list address set for that Safelist your mailing to.<br />
      <br />
      If you are not it could mean a number of things.<br />
      <br />
      1 - Your Email Inbox got full.<br />
      2 - Your Email intermittently bounces.<br />
      3 - You are looking in the wrong Email box for what you are expecting.<br />
      <br />
      Our systems mail all emails all the time.  We are not responsible for the RECEIVING Mail Servers reliablity.  The Email is sent to the server once and we receive a bounce Back Email saying why we couldn't connect to the server.  We anaylse all bounce emails and have a  system in place to extract exact data from them.<br />
      <br />
      There are literally 1000's that use our system.  And therefore if a system failure happens it more often effects EVERYONE and not just individuals.  Our server/database/mailer systems are very reliable!
