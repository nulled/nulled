  <H3>Filing Complaints</H3>Once you have <A
  href="headers.htm">determined
  the origin</A> of the spam, you are ready to file a complaint with the
  spammer's ISP (Internet Service Provider). Most ISPs have a dedicated address
  for complaints about spam or other abuses. This address is often
  'abuse@domain.com', but may be different for each ISP.
  <P>Here are some guidelines to follow when preparing your complaint.
  <UL>
    <LI>Put the complaint <I>before</I> the body of the forwarded message.
    <LI><I>Always</I> <EM>forward the offending spam </EM>to the ISP. Do not
    cut, paste, and re-send it because it may create extra email headers. Leave
    the headers intact.
    <LI>Keep your complaint short and non-abusive. The spam did not come from
    the ISP, it came from a user on the ISP's system. For example, write "I
    received this unsolicited commercial email from one of your users. Please
    take the appropriate action to ensure this doesn't happen again."
    <LI>Only send one complaint per spam received. Most ISP's have an auto-reply
    system for messages sent to 'abuse'. Sending multiple messages won't get
    your problem resolved any faster and only adds to the work for the ISP.
    <LI>Mail-bombing, threatening, or attempting to disrupt an ISP's service
    will never get your problem resolved, and may also be illegal. </LI></UL>If
  your message bounces back as undeliverable, visit the website of the domain
  you are trying to contact. Most ISP's will have an 'acceptable use' agreement
  on their sites detailing how to contact them regarding member abuses.
