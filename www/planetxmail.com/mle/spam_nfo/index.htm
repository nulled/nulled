<h3>Spam</h3>
 Within the Internet community, 'Spam' refers to the unsolicited commercial
 mass-mailings that constantly fill up electronic mailboxes and Usenet newsgroups. Spam
 offers everything from instant riches to a cure for baldness.

<b>Where Did it Come From?</b><br>
 Internet spam started a few years ago when an Arizona law firm sent advertisements to over
 6000 newsgroups. People were outraged and responded by flooding the law firm's ISP with
 thousands of complaints. Other people posted the lawyer's home addresses and phone
 numbers, and made death threats against them. The harsh reaction from the net community
 made others who were considering similar advertising think twice.
<p>
 There was one man who was undaunted by the potential fallout and saw this as a new
 business opportunity: Sanford Wallace. Wallace began the company 'Cyberpromo', a company
 that would gain infamy around the Internet as one of the worst offenders of spamming. This
 company has appeared many times in the newspaper and on television as the "King of
 Spam".
