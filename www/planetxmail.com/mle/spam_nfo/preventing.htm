  <H3>Preventing Spam</H3>Here are some effective ways to keep your email
  address from being sold or abused by spammers.
  <UL>
    <LI><B>Removal Addresses: </B><I>Never </I>respond to the 'removal request'
    email address that shows up in some spam. Doing so is a quick way to end up
    on the list of dozens of other spammers. It's best just to complain directly
    to the spammer's service provider.
    <LI><B>Usenet Newsgroups</B>: <I>Never </I>post a message to a newsgroup
    <I>using your real email address</I>. A very simple way to cloak your
    address from the spam-robots is to add 'spam-bait' to it. For instance, if
    your email address is "jdoe@internet.com" change it to something like
    "jdoe|NO_Spam@internet.com|NoSpam". This makes it easy for others to see
    your address, but the spam robots cannot make that distinction (yet...). Use
    spam-bait on email addresses in your news-reader program and in any
    signature files you use. Robots can get your address from there too.
    <LI><B>Personal Websites</B>: If you have your own website, never put a link
    to your email address on it unless you cloak it as described above. Instead,
    try a mailto CGI script that lets people fill out a form on your page. There
    are several online resources for creating your own scripts. Consult your ISP
    if you need help setting them up.
    <LI><B>Online Services</B>: <I>Never </I>publish a 'user profile'. Find out
    if you can request exclusion from any member directories. Ask the service
    about setting up a separate user ID (with separate email box) that you can
    use for chat rooms or newsgroups. Also, ask if the service offers any mail
    filters to keep messages from known spammers out of your mailbox.
    <LI><B>Online Software Registration</B>: <I>Always </I>double check which
    options you are checking when registering your software. Online registration
    programs often let you choose to have your address added to a list of
    addresses so the business can send you email. Sometimes you have to
    <I>uncheck</I> a box if you don't want advertisements.
    <LI><B>Electronic News Subscriptions</B>: The same warnings as above apply
    here. Read the options very carefully. </LI></UL
