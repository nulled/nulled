			<h3>Never get your confirmation emails sent?</h3>
			If you never seem to get your confirmation links sent for planetxmail.com safelists, please continue reading.
			<br><br>
			Some mail servers may have blocked ours.. we are trying to get OUT OF spews.org
			We obtained a few bad IP addresses from our server provider (ISP) These IPs were previously owned by porn spammers.
			I want to stress that it was not an epidemic problem, just one person spammed from their service and so spews.org has not
			let go since.  Now that we use the IP addresses we are now forced to mop up the mess, even though we have NEVER spammed
			and are not associated with the previous owners of our IP addresses in any way.  You can help us get this mess cleared!
			<br><br>
			What I suggest is you tell all those that DO NOT get confirmation emails from planetxmail.com to post to this
			<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=news.admin.net-abuse.email" target="_BLANK">Bulleton Board</a>
			and  bitch up a storm!
			<br><br>
			<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=news.admin.net-abuse.email" target="_BLANK">Post Here</a>
			<br><br>
			Be sure to mention the IP addresses <b>205.252.89.252-254</b> need to get removed from spews.org black list
			spews.org is very losely managed, as a result they put people on their ( spam blockers list ) with no investigation...
			<br><br>
			Planet x mail is clean we just need to clear that IP address as the previous owner is no longer using it ( or in business. )
			<br><br>
			If we work together the more word the better chance to get it removed from spews.org
			<br><br>
			Also note that there are a large number of ISPs that use spews.org black lists but there are more of them that DO NOT.. so being on this list isn't all THAT much of a problem for most, but as you have witnessed some are effected by this.

			<br><br>
			Be sure mention to the IP addresses <b>205.252.89.252-254</b>  need to get removed from spews.org black list.  If enough people are complaining they have no choice but to listen.
