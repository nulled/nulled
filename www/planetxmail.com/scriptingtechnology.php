  <b>PHP scripting language</b>
  <p>
  PHP is the basis for which all our lists are powered by.  It is a server side scripting language, based
  on the foundations of a proven language syntax and concept ( the C language dating back to the 70's ) which
  allow everything from Database access, file I\O to dynamic HTML generation.  This means vast amounts of data,
  can be stored, retrieved then finally displayed via HTML to a web browser.
  It is fast, efficient, stable, powerful and has a proven assortment of API's for programmers to work with to create
  useful web applications.<br><br>PHP is also widely used on popular web server platforms like Unix, Linux and
  Microsoft.  This has lead to it to being one of the dominant server side scripting languages in the world today! All
  of our lists use PHP exclusively.</i>
