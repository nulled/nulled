    <div class="main_title">What To Do With Your Credits?</div>

    <div class="title">Free Members Can Become a Professional Member</div>
    <div class="box">
      <b>It is simple.</b>  Collect <i>20,000 Credits</i> and your Free Safelist Account will <i>automatically</i> Upgrade to a Professional
      Account. You will be sent a Congratulations Email and message at the top of the Earn Credits page.
      <br /><br />
      <b>As a Secondary Bonus</b>, You get to Keep the Credits, be Happy You are now at Pro Status and continue on with Your Goals!
      <br /><br />
      The way to Earn Credits is to look for <b>Earn URL/Links</b> in Member Email ADs.  If you look at any <b>SOLO AD</b> they will always contain
      an Earn URL/link, which give you <i>10 Times</i> the Normal Amount.
      <br /><br />
      You will need to log off and log back in to see Your Free Account is now Professional.
      <br /><br />
      It is just our way to say Thank You for Participating.

    <div class="title">Earn a Planet X Mail - SOLO AD</div>
    <div class="box">
      <b>It is simple.</b>  Collect <i>45,000 Credits</i>. Planet X Mail SOLO ADs are highly sought after.  Because, it does take
      a lot of time and effort to click URL/Links to
      Earn Credits and Mail Out using the Regular and Credit Mailers.  Those that can afford it can just pay $30 for a Mailing
      to ALL members of ALL safelists (regardless if you are a member of any of them or not) is a pretty Good Deal and Feels Good.
      <br /><br />
      So, to allow people that can not afford $30 for the same Good Feeling of sending a SOLO AD (they always contain Earn URL/Links
      that are 10x times the normal amount) can send a SOLO AD by Earning Credits. So, if you like Earning Credits, here is another
      way to use them.
    </div>

    <div class="title">Earning Credits So You Can Mail More Per Day</div>

      you to Mail Twice In One Day.
      <br /><br />
