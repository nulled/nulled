    <h2>Bulk Lists and the 'Zombie Computer'</h2>
    'Bulk Lists' are probably the worst kinds of lists because they were 'harvested' using automated software
    programs that scourer Web Pages for email addresses. There have been many efforts to combat 'email harvesting'
    by encoding email addresses a certain way or to simply use an HTML Submission form that hides the recipients
    email address altogether. Unfortunately, many people freely place their email addresses in 'Talk Forums' and
    on their Personal Web Pages. Spammers then collect 'harvested bulk lists' which are nothing more than a list of
    email addresses, some working, some not. These 'bulk lists' are then used as the fuel for spam which is delivered by
    using 'zombie computers'.
    <br /><br/>
    A 'zombie computer' is one where a hacker has secretly placed mal/spyware (a virus) on an average everyday user
    home computer. (Typically users running Microsoft Windows) Since, many operating systems lack sufficient security,
    anyone with a computer connected to the internet could potentially be infected and turned into a computer that
    the spammers can control under the noses of the computer owner. According to some estimates, 50-75% of all the
    spam sent out into the World Wide Web is sent using 'zombie computers'.
    <br /><br />
    We recommend installing mal/spyware detection and removal software, anti-virus software and ensure your computer's firewall is
    On. This will <i>help</i> prevent your own machine from becoming a 'zombie computer'. Keep in mind that it is a never ending
    'arms race' between the hackers that support spammers, Operating Systems (DeskTops) and anti-virus software makers. I would
    like to suggest Comodo.com as they provide 100% free anti-virus, malware and advanced Firewall software! There is also the popular
    LavaSoft Spyware remove tool that has a free and paid version.
    <br /><br />
    To take it a step further, we recommend running a Linux Desktop such as Ubuntu (ubuntu.com) or PCLinuxOS (pclinuxos.com).
    Linux is an alternative to Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X Operating Systems. Linux is arguabley the most secure
    Operating System in the world.
    <br /><br />
    To learn more about Linux Desktops, you can read our blog/article entry entitled, 'The Peoples Desktop', <a href="index.php?option=mattsblog">by clicking here</a>.
    <br /><br />
    However, the #1 thing we can all do is <i>never open email attachments or run any programs</i> you
    download from the internet, unless you are <i>certain</i> it is safe to do so. Sometimes, it is hard to tell
    but that is what the mal/spyware software is useful for. It helps detect these viruses and quarantins them
    before they can 'burrow' into your hard drive and turn your own machine into a spammer controlled mail server!
    <br /><br />
    <h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
    This is a 'touchy' subject as it has political implications. 'Mailing Lists' are currently legal
    and protected under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. These types of lists are even more massive than 'Bulk Lists' because
    large corporations collect email addresses, typically after a product/service purchase is made on the internet. Or,
    by running a raffle, lottery or 'entering to win your free...<i>whatever</i>'.
    <br /><br />
    We have all seen the check boxes that state, 'Do you wish to receive notifications about products
    our company may offer in the future?'. Or something similar to that. Sometimes the checkbox is <i>checked
    for you</i> and you must uncheck it before clicking OK. This makes it very easy for people
    to simply not see or not completely read what they just agreed to! Yes, most of us are in a hurry and do
    not have the time to read everything on these Web Pages. Especially those that are cluttered with
    ADs and loads of small print, often with the font set to a color in order to make it difficult to spot.
    <br /><br />
    After your email address (knowingly or not) gets on one of these large
    corporate 'mailing lists', you are subject to your email address being sold off, often to other large
    corporations participating in a sharing of customer 'mailing lists'. Yet, more dangerous is the selling of small
    'portions' of the huge mailing lists to anyone willing to buy them.
    <br /><br />
    This then begs the questions, "How does anyone know if the people that are buying these email addresses are not
    spammers themselves or just advertisers not knowing the difference between self control and over mailing?
    Also, what if they buy a portion of a list only to then turn around and sell them off themselves?" As a result,
    that purchase you made a week earlier, <i>could</i> turn into your email address being transfered or sold to anyone that
    wants to buy it!
    <br /><br />
    An example of telemarketing (telephone) based spam, we have all seen those brand new cars in the middle of a busy
    shopping mall. Passer bys are presented with a simple 'sign up to win this car' form which, collects your name, address and
    telephone number via a drop box. Within a few days you are called, via telephone, by up to 5 different companies trying to persuade
    you to buy into completely unrelated products/services as compared to that car you entered to win! If you submitted your
    home mailing address, you will receive untold amounts of 'postal snail mail'! Email addresses are obtained, sold and transfer
    in much the same fashion, only this time using the internet and email as the communication medium. (So, in a way we can all
    be wary of receiving spam on 3 different mediums. Telephone, Home Mailing Address and Email Address.)
    <br /><br />
    To give credit where credit is due, these corporations are following Federal Laws, in particular the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. This 'Act'
    states that if you click on the remove me link in the email ad the corporation has no more than 30 days to
    completely flush your email address from their mailing list system. The reason the CAN-SPAM Act allows a full
    <i>30 days</i> to let them process the removal request is because by then your email address <i>may</i> have probagated to
    several dozens of other mailing lists and so the combined corporations need to update their unsubscribe
    lists, collectively.
    <br /><br />
    Remember, that telephone number you could call that would add your telephone number to the 'do not
    telemarket me' list? In other words, if <i>you</i> do not voluntarily <i>spend your time</i> and add yourself to these
    <i>un</i>subscribe lists, you will continue to be advertised/spammed! It's big business as you can now imagine!
    <br /><br />
    There have been recent debates in Congress to re-evaluate the 2003 CAN-SPAM Act. This has drawn
    a lot of lobbyists to <i>contest</i> such reform for obvious reasons of potential profit loss,
    if the CAN-SPAM Act was made to be more restrictive.
    <br /><br />
    <h2>What makes SafeLists Safe, Secure and Go Beyond Current Laws?</h2>
    First off, SafeLists protect member privacy, including email addresses, from all other members. Members' will
    receive email from others on the SafeList, but are assured that member information, including email addresses,
    can not be 'obtained' by any SafeList member, or <i>any</i> other entity for that matter. <i>More importantly</i>,
    our Safelists operate soley on Double-Optin based mechanisms.
    <br /><br />
    We have personally consulted with the organization known as SpamHaus (spamhaus.org based in the U.K.).
    In fact, we <i>agree</i> with the U.K.s DOUBLE-OPTIN approach to the spam problem. The U.K. believes the U.S. to
    be lagging behind in the fight against spam. After all, it was the british comedy show, Monty Python, that
    first coined to term 'spam' as relating to unsolicited email ads!
    <br /><br />
    All of this is detailed on our <a href="index.php">home page</a>. We encourage you to read it.
    Not about Monty Python, but about how Planet X Mail operates. :-)
    <br /><br />
    <h2>To conclude...</h2>
    We do not condon nor point fingers at any company, because it is really hard to tell
    which companies sell their mailing lists and which ones use them legitimately. Example: If
    I buy a computer from Dell and I subscribe to their notifications/promotions, I expect to ONLY receive emails
    from Dell and no other company. (Unless I authorize otherwise.) Dell has not shown any such activity. That is why
    I run Dell computers myself! They are in the business of selling computers. There are some corporations that are
    in the business of trading and selling your email addresses and other personal information.
